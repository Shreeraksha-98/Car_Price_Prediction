# Car Price Prediction:

# The data conatins car prices of various car companies based on various features like carwidth, engine size, fuel type, highway mpg etc.
# The data is cleaned and then the bi-variate analysis is done w.r.t the price column of the data set
# The skewness of the data is treated by treating the outliers using IQR method
# The data is then split for training and testing
# As there is multi-colinearity in the data, PCA is used to explain the variance
# The liner regression model is trained and tested on the testing data.
